# Developing `oni-ml` from IntelliJ

[IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is a popular IDE choice. To import an [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)
project written predominantly in [scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) to the development environment one needs to 
[install](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/installing-updating-and-uninstalling-repository-plugins.html) 
the respective plugins for [sbt](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/5007?pr=idea) and 
[scala](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/?id=1347).

Given that these plugins are installed in your environment you can simply navigate to `File -> Open` and choose
the `oni-ml` project on the file system location where it exists.
